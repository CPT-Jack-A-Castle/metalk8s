   Introduction
   ============

MetalK8s_ is an opinionated Kubernetes_ distribution with a focus on long-term
on-prem deployments, launched by Scality_ to deploy its Zenko_ solution in
customer datacenters.

It is based on the Kubespray_ project to reliably install a base Kubernetes
cluster, including all dependencies (like etcd_), using the Ansible_
provisioning tool. This installation is further augmented with operational
tools for monitoring and metering, including Prometheus_, Grafana_,
ElasticSearch_ and Kibana_. Furthermore, an "ingress controller" is deployed
by default, based on Nginx_. All of these are managed as Helm_ packages. See
:doc:`/reference-guide/cluster-services` for a whole listing.

Unlike hosted Kubernetes solutions, where network-attached storage is available
and managed by the provider, we assume no such system to be available in
environments where MetalK8s is deployed. As such, we focus on managing
node-local storage, and exposing these volumes to containers managed in the
cluster. See :doc:`/reference-guide/storage` for more information.
