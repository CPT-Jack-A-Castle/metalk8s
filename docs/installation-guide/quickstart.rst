Quickstart Guide
================
This guide describes how to set up a MetalK8s_ cluster. It offers general
requirements and describes sizing, configuration, and deployment. With respect
to installation procedures, the only significant difference between a test
cluster and a full production environment is the amount of resources required
to implement the design.

.. _MetalK8s: https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/
.. _CentOS: https://www.centos.org
.. _Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io

General Cluster Requirements
----------------------------
Setting up a MetalK8s cluster quickly requires at least three machines
running CentOS_ 7.4 or higher (these can be VMs) to which you have SSH access.
Each machine acting as a Kubernetes_ node (all three in the present example)
must also have at least one disk available to provision storage volumes.

Sizing
^^^^^^

Each node must satisfy the following sizing requirements.

.. note::
   The root file system requires at least 20 GB.

+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+
|    Component    | etcd   | Master | Node  |
+=================+========+========+=======+
| Cores           | 2      | 4      | 4     |
+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+
| RAM             | 4 GB   | 8 GB   | 8 GB  |
+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+
| Minimum         |        |        |       |
| dedicated       |        |        |       |
| storage capacity|        |        |       |
| required        |    -   |    -   | 128 GB|
+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+

Proxies
^^^^^^^
For nodes operating behind a proxy, add the following lines to each cluster
server's :file:`/etc/environment` file:

.. code-block:: shell

 http_proxy=http://user;pass@<HTTP proxy IP address>:<port>
 https_proxy=http://user;pass@<HTTPS proxy IP address>:<port>
 no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.*

Download the MetalK8s Source
----------------------------
Go to the MetalK8s releases_ page and download the source code zip file
for the release you wish to install.
When the download is complete, unpack the zipped file.

.. _releases: https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/releases

Define an Inventory
-------------------
Each server must be configured in an inventory that identifies the servers to
the Ansible_-based deployment system, as well as their basic configuration,
including masters and nodes.

The inventory is a directory that contains a :file:`hosts` file, which lists
all hosts in the cluster, and a subdirectory (:file:`group_vars`) that contains
:file:`kube-node.yml`, a configuration file.

.. _Ansible: https://www.ansible.com

To create an inventory:

1. Log in to the machine to which you downloaded the MetalK8s project.

2. Create a directory (for example, :file:`inventory/quickstart-cluster`) in
   which the inventory will be stored. Change to that directory.

   .. code-block:: shell

    $ cd metalk8s
    $ mkdir -p inventory/quickstart-cluster
    $ cd inventory/quickstart-cluster/

3. Create the :file:`hosts` file, which lists all hosts.

   .. code-block:: ini

    node-01 ansible_host=10.0.0.1 ansible_user=centos
    node-02 ansible_host=10.0.0.2 ansible_user=centos
    node-03 ansible_host=10.0.0.3 ansible_user=centos

    [kube-master]
    node-01
    node-02
    node-03

    [etcd]
    node-01
    node-02
    node-03

    [kube-node]
    node-01
    node-02
    node-03

    [k8s-cluster:children]
    kube-node
    kube-master

   Change the host names, IP addresses, and user names to conform to your
   infrastructure. For example, if your servers are named "server1", "server2",
   and "server3", copy the code block above and replace ALL instances of
   "node-0" with "server".

  .. warning::

     Using the remote `root` user to deploy MetalK8s is not supported, see
     :ref:`ansible-user-root-detection`.

4. Create a :file:`group_vars` subdirectory in the directory you created in
   step 2 (the one that contains the :file:`hosts` file) and change to it.

   .. code-block:: shell

    $ mkdir group_vars ; cd group_vars

5. In the :file:`group_vars` subdirectory, create a :file:`kube-node.yml` file.
   This file declares how to set up hosts in the kube-node group; that is,
   hosts on which pods shall be scheduled:

   .. code-block:: yaml

    metalk8s_lvm_drives_vg_metalk8s: ['/dev/vdb']

   This example assumes every *kube-node* host has a disk available as
   :file:`/dev/vdb` that can be used to set up Kubernetes *PersistentVolumes*.
   For more information, see :ref:`storage-architecture`.

Enter the MetalK8s Virtual Environment Shell
--------------------------------------------
To install a supported version of Ansible and its dependencies, along with
some Kubernetes tools (:program:`kubectl` and :program:`helm`), MetalK8s
provides a :program:`make` target that installs these in a local environment.
To enter this environment, run :command:`make shell` (this takes a few
seconds when first run)::

    $ make shell
    Creating virtualenv...
    Installing Python dependencies...
    Downloading kubectl...
    Downloading Helm...
    Launching MetalK8s shell environment. Run 'exit' to quit.
    (metalk8s) $

Deploy the Cluster
------------------

Run the following command to deploy the cluster::

  (metalk8s) $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/quickstart-cluster/hosts -b playbooks/deploy.yml

For a simple test deployment such as the present three-node cluster, this takes
about a half hour. Actual deployment time will vary based on the size of the
cluster and hardware and network performance.

Inspect the Cluster
-------------------
Deployment creates a file containing credentials to access the cluster
(:file:`inventory/quickstart-cluster/artifacts/admin.conf`). Remaining in the
virtual environment shell, export this location to give :program:`kubectl` and
:program:`helm` the correct credentials to contact the cluster’s *kube-master*
nodes::

    (metalk8s) $ export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/inventory/quickstart-cluster/artifacts/admin.conf

If your system can reach port 6443 on the master node
referred to in ``admin.conf``, you can

* List all nodes::

    (metalk8s) $ kubectl get nodes

Cluster Services
----------------
Services to operate and monitor your MetalK8s cluster are provided. To
access these dashboards:

1. If you are accessing the cluster using a machine from which you didn't
   install MetalK8s, copy the credentials in admin.conf and export its path
   (see `Inspect the Cluster`_).

2. Open port 6443 on your cluster’s master nodes for remote access to cluster
   services.

3. Inside a ``make shell`` environment, run ``kubectl proxy`` from your local machine.
   This opens a tunnel to the Kubernetes cluster, which makes the following tools available:
