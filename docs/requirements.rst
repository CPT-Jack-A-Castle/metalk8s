Requirements
============

Deployment
----------
- Fully offline
- Fully idempotent
- Installation == upgrade

Binaries
--------
- All binaries ending up on host system installed using system packages (RPM)
- All generated configuration files contain a comment line describing the file
  was generated by this project, including project version (?) and timestamp (?,
  how to match with idempotency?)
- OCI images: built FROM CentOS, parametrized, containing all default labels,
  only installing packages through `yum`, proper `entrypoint` defined
- All processes running as non-root where possible, including those managed by
  Kubelet
- Repackaged `runc` with `kmem` leak fix

Networking
----------
- Everything over-the-wire using TLS
- TLS certificates short-living, except root CAs
- Use somewhat-short-living intermediate CAs
- All services bound to specific address, derived from appropriate CIDR
- `kube-apiserver` HA through keepalived, including IPVS
  * Health-checks on TLS `/healthz` returning `ok`

Upgrades
--------
- Node cordon / drain / uncordon
