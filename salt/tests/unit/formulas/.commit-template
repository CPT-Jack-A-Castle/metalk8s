TODO:
- define "architecture" config option to prepare a set of minions
- test cases for downgrade.init:
    - all documented architectures (single node, compact, standard, extended)
    - partial upgrades (some minions are already upgraded, use "pillar_overrides")

Add mock for `pkg.version_cmp`.

Running `tox -e unit-tests -- -m formulas` shows:
- 219 passed
